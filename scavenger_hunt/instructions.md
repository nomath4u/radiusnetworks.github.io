## Beacon Scavenger Hunt Setup Instructions

These instructions describe how to set up a scavenger hunt using Radius Networks' Beacon Scavenger Hunt app available in the iOS AppStore and the Google Play store.
You may also customize the application itself, as we have releaed both the iOS and open source versions.  The rest of this document
describes how to set up a new hunt with the Radius Networks Beacon Scavenger Hunt apps, although the same steps apply to your own app (except
publishing a hunt code.)

###Step 1. Decide on your targets

Pick interesting targets that are more than 10 meters apart and can be associated with a visual icon.  We recommend 6-12 targets.  Picking target locations
with AC or USB power will allow you to use powered beacons.  Picking indoor locations will allow you to avoid setting up weatherproof enclosures
for your beacons.

###Step 2. Get your Beacons

However many targets you have, you'll need to order at least the same number of [beacons](http://store.radiusnetworks.com/collections/all) (and more if you want spares.)  Each one must be assigned a different
three part identifier.  Write down which target is associated with which beacon three part identifier.

###Step 3. Create badge images for each target location

Making badge images requires the most work.  You will need to make two different badge images for each location -- one to indicate a target that is not
found and one to indicate a target that is found.  Depending on what platforms you want to support, you may want to include other variants of these badges, too.

At a minimum, you need one standard resolution badge pair (found / not found) for each target that is at least 260 pixels by 260 pixels in size. Smaller images will work, but will appear blurry on most devices. Ideally, these images should be square so that they fit the display space provided within the app properly. 

They should be named like below, and uploaded to a web server.  (See Appendix B below for information on how to set up a web server to host your images.)   Once you have them uploaded, write down the mapping between each target and each image URL.

    target1.png
    target1_found.png
    target2.png
    target2_found.png
    ...


You may want to create another set of images for high density displays, but this is only to optimize the sharpness of your image and is completely unnecessary. Full details on the high density image filenames needed to do this are at the bottom of this document.


###Step 4. Configure ProximityKit

If you don't have a [ProximityKit](http://www.proximitykit.com) account already, create one.  You can use the free service license if you expect to have 100 people or fewer playing your scavenger hunt.  See plans for details.

Create a new Kit, then define one beacon for each scavenger hunt target.  For each one, you'll need to enter the three-part beacon identifier along wtih two key/value pairs.  The first key/value pair
has a key of "hunt\_id" and a value of your target number.  Put "1" for your first target, "2" for your second target, etc.  The second key/value pair is for your "image_url" of your badge image for that target.  You only need to
specify the "image_url" for the basic image, because the variants will all be discovered by following the filename conventions described in this document.

When you are done, your setup should look like this for a single target:

<img src='images/scavengerhunt-pk-setup.png'/>

###Step 5. Distribute your 8-digit hunt code.

Note:  This step is only necessary if you are using the Radius Networks app.  If you are using a custom app, users will not have to enter a hunt code because the configuration will
be loaded automatically by embedding your ProximityKit.plist or ProximityKit.properties file in your app.

When using the Radius Beacon Scavenger Hunt apps, your hunt is selected by particpants by entry of an 8-digit code.  This code can then be distributed to your
participants by posting it on a sign or a website, sending it to them via email, etc.  Turning on an 8-digit code will eventually be selectable in the ProximityKit web interface.  For now, creating this code is a manual process which must be requested with an email to support@radiusnetworks.com that must include your ProximityKit kit URL.

Once you receive confirmation that your code is live, you can try out your scavenger hunt.



## Appendix A:  Full details on image filenames

These images should be 130x130 pixels.

#####Additional images for iPhone retina displays:

    target1_260.png
    target1_found_260.png

These images should be 260x260 pixels.

#####Additional images for iPad

    target1_312.png
    target1_624.png
    target1_found_312.png
    target1_found_624.png

These image sizes should be as indicated in the suffix.

## Appendix B: How to host your images on a web server

In order to make a scavenger hunt, you will need a web server where you can host the images for each badge associtated with a target.  The hosting server or service must allow you to specify the filename of the image on the URL, making some free services like imgur.com unworkable, because they change the filename of your image.

If you do not have your own web server, two good options are Github (free) and Amazon S3.  

With Github, you can create a free account and a new *public* repository, then upload each image to the repository.  After you do so, you can use the Github raw URL to specify the image location.  You can see an example of how this is set up for the scavenger hunt example by looking at the public repository for the [scavenger hunt sample images](https://github.com/RadiusNetworks/scavenger-hunt-sample-images).  An example raw URL for a scavenger hunt images in this case is found by clicking on the "raw" link for each image, which gives you something like: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RadiusNetworks/scavenger-hunt-sample-images/master/target1.png

Details on how to set up Amazon S3 for website hosting can be found [here.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html)
