## Scavenger Hunt Codes

In order to participate in a scavenger hunt, you need to obtain a six-digit code from the organizer.  
If you don't have a code, but just want to see how it looks, you can see the example by entering 00000000.  When viewing
the example you won't be able to find the targets unless you are visiting our office.

## How can I organize a scavenger hunt?

If you want to organize a scavenger hunt, you need to get one iBeacon for each target location in your hunt.  You then need basic
design skills to create the badge images that will appear in the app for each location.  Finally, you have to configure your target
iBeacons using our ProximityKit web service.  This is free for 100 participants or fewer, and there is a small monthly cost for 
larger number of participants.
