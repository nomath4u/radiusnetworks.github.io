##Locate Help

<!--
Locate is an app intended to find beacons following the [AltBeacon](http://altbeacon.org) standard, an open beacon specification.  *This app will not detect beacons based on a closed proprietary standards from Apple, Qualcomm or other vendors.*  For more information on obtaining AltBeacon devices and test tools, please visit [altbeacon.org](http://altbeacon.org).

###Filtering Beacons

By default, the app will show all visible AltBeacons.  You may filter the beacons the app sees by going to settings and editing the "Beacon Region Filter"  These settings allow you to optionally select a ID1 (in UUID form), an ID2 (0-65535), and ID3 (0-65535) for the Beacons you want to see.  Only Beacons matching the entered field values will be visible by the app.

If you don't want to restrict visible Beacons to having a field value, leave it blank.

###Alerting for Beacons

The Locate app can alert you whenever one or more Beacons matching the active filter are nearby by displaying an alert.

This feature can be configured by going to settings, selecting "Monitoring Configuration" and enabling the Notify on Entry, Notify on Exit options.

###Distance Measurements

The Locate app will show an estimate of the distance to any visible Beacon.  This estimate is based on the Bluetooth signal strength, and due to noise and multipath effects there is a large amount of variation.  

The distance estimate is based on a transmitter power calibration value stored in the AltBeacon and transmitted with each of its advertisements.  In order to optimize the accuracy of the distance estimate, it is necessary to calibrate each AltBeacon's transmitter power and then store the configuration measurement in the AltBeacon.

###Calibrating AltBeacons

You can calibrate an AltBeacon by tapping it in the app, selecting the calibration option, holding your phone or tablet one meter away from the AltBeacon transmitter, then tapping the calibrate button.  Calibration will take from 30 seconds to one minue, during which time you should keep your device at a distance of one meter from the beacon.
