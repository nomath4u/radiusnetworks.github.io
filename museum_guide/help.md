## Museum Guide Codes

In order to use the Museum Guide, you need to obtain a six-digit code from the site offering the tour.
If you don't have a code, but just want to see how it looks, you can see the example by entering 00000003.  This will show you the sample Fietze House Museum.  When viewing
the example you will only be able to use the automatic mode to find the museum items if you set up your own iBeacons.  The sample museum uses an iBeacon with UUID: 2F234454-CF6D-4A0F-ADF2-F4911BA9FFA6, Major: 1, Minor 1 for the first item in the museum.  Items 2-7 in the museum have Minor values 2-7.

## How can I make a museum guide for my gallery?

If you want to set up a museum guide, you need to get one iBeacon for each location that is part of the tour.  You then need a photo of each item on the tour, and 
a web pages to describe each item.  Finally, you have to configure your target
iBeacons using our ProximityKit web service.  This is free for 100 visitors or fewer, and there is a small monthly cost for
larger number of visitors.
