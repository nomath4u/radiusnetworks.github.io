title: A Note From the CEO

You may have noticed some changes to our website and to the products and technologies that we offer. I want to take a moment to give you a little insight and understanding of why these changes have occurred.

The market for proximity beacons and technologies is young and dynamic. Apple helped greatly to push this market forward with the release of iBeaconâ„¢ technology and iOS 7 in the fall of 2013.  Since then, proximity technology and services has become one of the hottest areas of growth in mobile technology.

Prior to Apple introducing their iBeacon License Program, there were no clear guidelines from Apple on iBeacon trademark and intellectual property (IP) usage.  Apple has since made great strides in formalizing their program and communicating the appropriate usage of iBeacon as a trademark and proper handling of iBeacon IP.

As a certified Apple iBeacon partner, we feel that it is important to respect the terms and spirit of our agreement.  As a result, we have made the following changes:

* Removed documentation describing the technical details of iBeacon advertisements.
* Removed iBeacon-related libraries, SDKs and application implementations for mobile devices other than iOS devices.

We understand that you, our valued customers and partners, may be impacted by these changes.  Please be assured that we also understand and appreciate how important it is to provide proximity solutions for multiple mobile device platforms, so we ask that you stay tuned, as we have additional exciting solutions that we will be introducing very soon.  We believe that these new updates will ultimately create stronger and more robust solutions for our customers and our partners.

Sincerely,

Marc Wallace

Co-Founder & CEO
