title: A Note From the CEO
author: Marc Wallace

You may have noticed some changes to our website and to the products and technologies that we offer. I want to take a moment to give you a little insight and understanding of why these changes have occurred.

Our Proximity Kit SDKs and Android Beacon Pro Libraries are in transition at the moment and we felt the best step was to remove these from further distribution until this transition was complete.

We understand that you, our valued customers and partners, may be impacted by these changes.  Please be assured that we also understand and appreciate how important it is to provide proximity solutions for multiple mobile device platforms, so we ask that you stay tuned, as we have additional exciting solutions that we will be introducing very soon.  We believe that these new updates will ultimately create stronger and more robust solutions for our customers and our partners.

Sincerely,

Marc Wallace
Co-Founder & CEO
