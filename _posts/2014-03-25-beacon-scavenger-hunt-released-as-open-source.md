title: Beacon Scavenger Hunt Released as Open Source
author: David G. Young

One of the most fun things you can do with beacons is build a scavenger hunt:  Set up a half dozen or so beacons in interesting spots, then make an app that lets participants find all the targets as quickly as possible.  We organized one at the Consumer Electronics Show this year played by hundreds of people, and it was pretty cool!  Building the app, though, was a whole lot of work.

What if you could host a scavenger hunt of your own without going to the trouble to build your own app?  Now you can, with Radius Networks' new 
[Beacon Scavenger Hunt app for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beacon-scavenger-hunt/id821092269?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radiusnetworks.scavengerhunt).   You simply make a custom graphical badge for each of your targets,  configure a beacon to go with each, then distribute a hunt code to your participants to let them play.  Your scavenger hunt can be up and going in just a couple of hours!

Better yet, if you want to make an even more customized experience, you can modify the app to do whatever you want -- we've released it as open source for both iOS and Android.

Scavenger hunts are great team building events at conferences and meetings.  And they are perfect for trade shows or other venues to encourage people to visit far flung areas.
The Beacon Scavenger Hunt app is available now for free in the [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beacon-scavenger-hunt/id821092269?mt=8) and the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radiusnetworks.scavengerhunt) store.   The source code is available on Github for both [iOS](https://github.com/RadiusNetworks/scavenger-hunt-ios-os) and [Android](https://github.com/RadiusNetworks/scavenger-hunt-android-os).

The app is built on top of our [Proximity Kit](http://proximitykit.com) cloud service for beacons, which makes it possible to do all your app's beacon configuration in the cloud.  This configurability is what makes creating different Beacon Scavenger Hunts with the same app possible.  Think of the other things Proximity Kit could do for your own project.

So what are you waiting for?  Download the app, [get your hands on some beacons](http://www.radiusnetworks.com/buy-beacons.html) and read the [full instructions](http://developer.radiusnetworks.com/scavenger_hunt/instructions.html) to set up your own scavenger hunt today!
