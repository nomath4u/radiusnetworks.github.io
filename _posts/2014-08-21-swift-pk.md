title: Using ProximityKit with Swift
author: Michael Harper

Swift is the new programming language from Apple announced at WWDC 2014.  In my copious free time, I've been getting both my hands dirty _and_ my feet wet with Swift on several projects.


Here I'll show you how straightforward it is to use ProximityKit for iOS with Swift.

Let's Get Our Swift On

1. In order to use Swift, you need to install and run Xcode 6 or newer.
1. Create a new iOS Single View Application project.

2. We'll call ours "SwiftBeacon". Make sure you select "Swift" in the Language menu.

3. Close the project window as we're going to use CocoaPods to include ProximityKit in the app.
4. Add a `Podfile` to the root directory of your project.  It should contain the following:
   ```
   platform :ios
   pod 'ProximityKit'
   ```
5. Then run:
   ```
   $ pod install
   ```
6. Now open the `.xcworkspace` file for your project going forward so that the ProximityKit CocoaPod is automatically included.
7. Download the ProximityKit configuration file for your kit and copy it into your Xcode project.  My project now looks like this:
   
   <img style="margin:10px; border: thin solid #333;" src='/img/swift-3.png'>

At this point, you should be able to build and run this app on your phone.  It'd be a good idea to do this right now, just to be sure you've done everything properly up to this point.  On my phone, the app simply displays a white screen.
