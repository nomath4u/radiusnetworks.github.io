title: Using ProximityKit with Swift
author: Michael Harper
---
Swift is the new programming language from Apple announced at WWDC 2014.  In my copious free time, I've been getting both my hands dirty _and_ my feet wet with Swift on several projects.


Here I'll show you how straightforward it is to use ProximityKit for iOS with Swift.

Let's Get Our Swift On
---

1. In order to use Swift, you need to install and run Xcode 6 or newer.

2. Create a new iOS Single View Application project.

3. We'll call ours "SwiftBeacon". Make sure you select "Swift" in the Language menu.

   <img style="margin:10px; border: thin solid #333;" src='/img/swift-2.png'>

4. Close the project window as we're going to use CocoaPods to include ProximityKit in the app.

5. Add a `Podfile` to the root directory of your project.  It should contain the following

   ```
   platform :ios
   pod 'ProximityKit'
   ```

6. Then run

   ```
   $ pod install
   ```

7. Now open the `.xcworkspace` file for your project going forward so that the ProximityKit CocoaPod is automatically included.

8. Download the ProximityKit configuration file for your kit and copy it into your Xcode project.  My project now looks like this:
   
   <img style="margin:10px; border: thin solid #333;" src='/img/swift-3.png'>

At this point, you should be able to build and run this app on your phone.  It'd be a good idea to do this right now, just to be sure you've done everything properly up to this point.  On my phone, the app simply displays a white screen.

Bridging Swift and Objective-C
---

We now have a project containing some Swift code and the ProximityKit framework.  But the app is written in Swift and ProximityKit is written in Objective-C!  How will we bridge _that_ gap?

Of course, Apple thought about this and provides us with a solution called a "bridging header."

1. Create a new header file named `<project_name>-Bridging-Header.h`.  In our case, we're calling it `SwiftBeacon-Bridging-Header.h`.  You need not add this to any target since it's a simple header file.

   <img style="margin:10px; border: thin solid #333;" src='/img/swift-4.png'>

2. \#import the ProximityKit header file in the bridging header file.

   ```
   #import <ProximityKit/ProximityKit.h>
   ```

   You can include any other header files here for Objective-C items you need to access from your Swift code.
   
3. Set the bridging header file in the build settings for the app target.  Do this by selecting the target, then build settings, and search for "bridging". Set the value for the Objective-C Bridging Header to the name of the bridging header file you just created.  I found I had to precede it with the path to the file relative to the root directory of the project, e. g. `SwiftBeacon/SwiftBeacon-Bridging-Header.h`

   <img style="margin:10px; border: thin solid #333;" src='/img/swift-5.png'>

Once again, build and run your app to make sure you've setup your bridging header file properly.

Connect Swift Code to ProximityKit
---
All of the puzzle pieces are now in place so that we can hook up the app to ProximityKit.

1. Start by implementing the `PKManagerDelegate` protocol in your AppDelegate

   ```
   @UIApplicationMain
   class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate, PKManagerDelegate ...
   ```

2. Add a `PKManager` to your AppDelegate

   ```
   var proximityKitManager: PKManager?
   ```

3. Initialize and start `proximityKitManager` in `application()` method of your AppDelegate

   ```
   self.proximityKitManager = PKManager(delegate: self)
   self.proximityKitManager!.start()
   ```

4. Implement the `PKManagerDelegate` methods as necessary.

   ```
   func proximityKitDidSync(manager : PKManager) {
     NSLog("didSync")
   }
  
   func proximityKit(manager: PKManager!, didDetermineState state: PKRegionState, forRegion region: PKRegion!) {
     NSLog("didDetermineState \(state) for region \(region)")
   }
  
   func proximityKit(manager : PKManager, didEnter region:PKRegion) {
     NSLog("didEnter region %@", region)
   }
  
   func proximityKit(manager : PKManager, didExit region:PKRegion) {
     NSLog("didExit region %@", region)
   }
  
   func proximityKit(manager : PKManager, didRangeBeacons beacons:NSArray, inRegion region:PKRegion) {
     NSLog("didRangeBeacons %@", beacons)
   }

   ```

Build and run once again.  Assuming you are in the vicinity of beacon(s) that are in your kit, you should see log messages in your debug console indicating what's going on with ProximityKit.
