### JavaDocs

The full JavaDocs of the open-source APIs are available [here.](http://developer.radiusnetworks.com/android-ibeacon-service/doc/)

The full JavaDocs of the Pro library APIs are available 
[here](/ibeacon/android/pro/javadocs/).  Additional documentation for the pro library is [here](/ibeacon/android/pro/documentation.html).

### Other Resources

Alternate configuration using a jar file is described [here](/ibeacon/android/alternate-configuration.html)

Instructions for using the BeaconSimulator is [here](/ibeacon/android/beacon_simulator.html).


### iOS API Mapping

The API is a modeled of the iBeacon parts of the iOS Location SDK as much as possible. Key differences include:

* The Android library supports wildcards for *ALL* iBeacon identifiers, allowing you to look see any iBeacon.
* The Ranging updates come every 1.1 seconds instead of 1.0 seconds due to time synchronization issues with Android Bluetooth scanning.
* The distance estimating algorithm approximates the iOS implementation, but it is not identical
* Ranging updates may be passed to background applications as well as foreground applications.

The table below shows the Android Class and the equivalent iOS class, with a link to the documentation.

### Supported Platforms

This library requires Android 4.3 (SDK version 18), because that is earliest SDK that supports low energy Bluetooth. 
The mobile device must also have a low energy Bluetooth chipset, sometimes called BLE or Bluetooth 4.0.  Most mid-range and above Android devices that started manufacturing in Mid-2012 or later have Bluetooth LE.  That said, it is still possibile to compile the library with apps targeting earlier versions as long as the APIs are only exercised on devices with Android 4.3+.

As of July 2014, Android devices known to have BLE include: Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, Samsung Galaxy Note II, Sansung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0/8.1/10.0, Nexus 7 2013 edition, Nexus 4/5, HTC One HTC Butterfly, HTC Evo LTE, HTC Desire X, LG G Pad, LG Optimus G, LG G2, Sony Experia Tablet S/Z, Sony Experia Z/L/P/M, Motorola Droid DNA, Motorola Droid Razr I/HD/Maxx, Motorola Moto X, Huawei Ascend G610/G700/G740/Y511/P2/D2/Mate, Huawei A199, Moto G, Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 (SM-T210)


Note:  The Kindle Fire HD supports Bluetooth 4.0, but there are currently no plans to make it upgradable to Android 4.3 without rooting the device.

### Known issues:

* [On the Nexus 4 and the Moto G, Bluetooth and WiFi do not work properly at the same time.](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=41631)  If this library is used on the Nexus 4 when WiFi is active, it may cause a dropped WiFi connection, inability to do Wifi scans, delays in seeing iBeacons, or a total inability to see iBeacons.  Turning off WiFi on the Nexus 4 solves these problems.  Similar problems have been reported, but uncomfirmed, with Nexus 7 devices
